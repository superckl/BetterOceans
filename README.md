# Better Oceans #

Better oceans is a mod that attempts to redefine the underwater experience in Minecraft. From adding seaweed to dangerous trenches, there will no longer be no use to exploring oceans.

Currently, it is only beginning development and is in the experimental phase. Experimental build can be found at http://jenkins.betteroceans.net
